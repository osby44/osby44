# Hello! My name is Abraham Ozegbe


# About Me

I am Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst, embarking on a journey of professional evolution and I am excited to introduce myself as an individual who has honed a wealth of experience in the realm of business management and is now venturing into the dynamic world of data analysis. With a proven track record of driving strategic initiatives, optimizing operational processes, and fostering organizational growth, I am eager to apply my analytical prowess to extract valuable insights from data and contribute meaningfully to the data-driven decision-making landscape.

Throughout my years in business management, I have cultivated a deep appreciation for the power of informed choices and the role data plays in shaping these choices. My keen understanding of business intricacies has provided me with a solid foundation upon which I am poised to build a robust data analysis skill set. As I transition into this exciting role, my goal is to bridge the gap between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of business, leveraging data-driven narratives to unveil untapped opportunities, streamline operations, and enhance overall strategic direction.

Having worked extensively with Microsoft Excel over the years, I have also undertaken formal training and self-study in various data analysis methodologies, statistical tools, and data visualization techniques such as Microsoft Power BI, Python and SQL. These efforts have equipped me with the technical acumen needed to handle complex datasets, conduct meaningful analyses, and communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I have some projects hosted here on GitHub to show case my skills using these tools.
